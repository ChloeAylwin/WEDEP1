Together Against Cancer Foundation is the name I have chosen for my website because it fits well with what we are doing. The main reason I have decided on this kind of website and idea was because I lost both my grandmothers to cancer, Nanny had breast cancer, as a little girl watching your grandparent once full of life now drained, seeing how cancer took over and not understanding why. Ouma had ovarian cancer, I remember always travelling far from home to visit her in the hospital, to waking up one morning hearing she didn't make it, the cancer had won. I wanted to change that, I want the woman surrounded by us know it's okay, and that Together Against Cancer is here to assist in helping and by trying to make a difference in your life and the strong and encouraging woman who suffer from this illness. We decided on non-profit because we understand how expensive treatment and hospital visits are already, instead we hold little fun walks and markets to raise money for the woman, we also encourage them to share their story with us by holding group meetings for support. We hope by doing this woman feel less alone, help ensure that during this rough time they have people, a community to turn to that struggle with the same things, uplifting their spirits when they have lost hope and is struggling with their journey and fight.
